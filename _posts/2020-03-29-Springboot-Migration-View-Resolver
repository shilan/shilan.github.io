You wanna migrate your legacy java jsp servlet base application to Spring boot 2 and Java the latest? Though you should get ready beforehand but don't get intimidated!
When we wanted to migrate our giant 7 years old application to Spring boot 6 months ago, his blog post was the best covering document.
But still we had our own challenges too.
Now that we are in production finally I am gonna write few posts how we resolved our problems.
## Today is about JSP view resolver

    <!-- Page-level JSP views are managed through spring internal viewResolver. alwaysInclude should be set
    	to true, otherwise spring boot changes dispatcherType of dispatches to jsps to FORWARD automatically. -->
    <bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">
        <property name="prefix">
            <value>/applications/jsp/</value>
        </property>
        <property name="suffix">
            <value>.jsp</value>
        </property>
        <property name="alwaysInclude">
        	<value>true</value>
        </property>
        <property name="contentType">
        	<value>text/html;charset=UTF-8</value>
        </property>
    </bean>
    
    InternalResourceViewResolver

	/**
	 * Specify whether to always include the view rather than forward to it.
	 * <p>Default is "false". Switch this flag on to enforce the use of a
	 * Servlet include, even if a forward would be possible.
	 * @see InternalResourceView#setAlwaysInclude
	 */
