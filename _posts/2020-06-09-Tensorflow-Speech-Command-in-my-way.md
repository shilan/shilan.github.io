There is a good (document)[https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/tutorials/sequences/audio_recognition.md] in tensorflow github on how to train and test you Deep Learning network to make this work. However as a beginner with Tensorflow I had few bumps but I somehow managed to go through it. So I thought I will write down them here so that none of us forget it.

First of all, I wanted to make Tensorflow training to run on my windows machine which happened to not have the Intel CPU.
